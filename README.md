fail0verflow
============

fail0verflow repository is a tribute for the old fail0verflow repository with LEGAL TOOLS deleted 
cowardly by github.com because of threats from licks-ass guys called "attorneys of SCEA".

The original code was forked more than 1300 guys (the second most forked repository in github.com)
who wanted to defend our rights as consumers, owners of our computer / console called PS3, and
like non-profit independent programmers. But again, in a system where money is more important than
justice, freedom and people (you are a number) the threat of one has much greater weight and repository
was deleted unceremoniously and without one word to explain the exact reason.

Because it, i was create this tribute that shows we "evil" usage of the old fail0verflow tools.

Pintor/fail0verflow
-------------------

'Pintor' is an old videogame made by me, initially, for PS2 console. It is strongly inspired in a
spectrum+ game that i remember fondly. I have done ports for a lot of consoles: PS2/GP2/GP2X/PSP/WII
and now PS3.

In this case it is based in the GP32 port, including the famous geohot MP3 "The Light It Up Contest"
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUvuaChDEg)

I think it is a very funny song ^^ and is suitable for the symbolism of this respository (also i use a
black background representing the PS3).

Pintor: the game
----------------

You are John Doe and must walk the way to complete the boxes to change to the next screen. But you have
to be careful because SCEA and their attorneys are looking to bite your ass. Fortunately, the enemies do
not think and are blinded by greed. So as donkeys, they pulled forward and forward, without knowing for 
sure where are you (here they cannot ask to github, google, paypal personal datas of John Doe)
